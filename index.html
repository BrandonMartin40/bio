            <p>Musician, music producer and  DJ with a debut studio album titled Ashes, which peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart. His second album, Awake, was present on the Billboard 200. He launched a record label, called Kasaya Recordings in tandem with Mr.Suicide Sheep's label, seeking blue. Illenium is quickly becoming a household name that appears on both festival lineups and venue marquees all over the country. With a skyrocketing career and insanely busy summer schedule performing at festivals close to every weekend. This is view on music "for me music is almost a spirtiual experience that brought me up from one of the lowest points in my life. Being able to share that positivity in an environment that brings people together is one of my favorite things. Music is something that anyone can experience and relate to regardless of their background. It's a very unifying force and I'm blessed to be a part of that" </p>
